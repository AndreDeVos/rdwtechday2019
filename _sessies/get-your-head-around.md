Last year the .NET Standard introduced a new way of creating highly portable .NET
assemblies. The .NET Standard was mainly targeted at library developers. Now, .NET
Standard 2.0 has much more impact on .NET developers of all platforms. And as it
turns out, the .NET Standard is not trivial to understand. In this session you will
learn what the .NET Standard is and how it is used to allow you to create
cross-platform .NET applications. You are going to see how version 2.0 is a big step
forwards for creating and migrating existing apps to new platforms such as .NET
Core. You will get practical guidance to start migrating existing libraries and
applications to .NET Standard 2.0, but also get to understand the internals. You are
going to see how .NET Standard 2.0 works under the covers during build time and
runtime, and how the standard is incorporated into the existing .NET platforms. At
the end of the session, you've got your head around .NET Standard 2.0 and you are
ready to use it in your .NET development with confidence and proper understanding.
