The landscape of distributed applications is rapidly changing from server-based to
using clusters of containers and server-less computing. .NET is capable of creating
such cross-platform applications, being run in Docker containers, but it is not
trivial to get started with this. This session will focus on providing an overview
of the changing world for .NET developers, with a new workflow that has Docker and
containers at its core. You will learn how Visual Studio 2017, .NET Core and Docker
play a strategic role in building, packaging, deploying and running modern .NET
applications, but also what it takes to develop these apps on your laptop and in
container clusters.
