To make the most of AI it is vital that you run AI experiments in
production. After all that is where the users of your system are. But where do you
start?

In this session we will introduce an architecture and methodology based on
continuous delivery and the lambda architecture to run AI experiments in production.
During the session you will get a chance to develop an experiment yourself with
Azure Machine Learning Workbench and deploy it on your Azure environment. We will
bring along the data and a model to get you going quickly. So you don't have to be a
data scientist to participate.
