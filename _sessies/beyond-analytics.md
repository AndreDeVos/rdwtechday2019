Companies across all industries are transforming their businesses by extracting value from all their data and not focusing solely on analytics. These companies actively use advanced data flows that are continuously being evaluated by machine learning algorithms to respond at scale, at the most detailed context of the business activity, and in a timely manner to the smallest predicted business pulses. Their ability to both detect and act in real time is having a profound impact on their business results.
 
Data is more scattered globally then ever which requires a global data fabric like MapR's Converged Data Platform to make data portable across private and public clouds as well as at the edge. This in combination with technologies like Kubernetes and Docker to make compute and applications portable by running them at the most optimal location enabling real-time impact and business benefits.
 
In this session Marc Huijbregts and Martijn Kieboom presents concrete uses across industries including advertising/media, financial services, healthcare and automotive sectors. They will highlight the capabilities used by companies to unlock the transformational value of their data as well as **run a live demonstration of connected cars sharing data in real-time**.
