Did you ever walk into a data center to do a deployment? The same goes for Cloud!
Cloud gives you some really nice options to do your DevOps and control your scripts.
This workshop shows you how to work with the cloud. We are going to configure a
DevOps environment in way to be in control of your Azure Resources. We will hookup
Visual Studio Team Services to your Azure Subscription respecting your
Dev/Test/Acc/Prod environments. Provide you a scripting environment with GIT at its
center with 4 eyes in place. And finally we will do a controlled and approved
release with Just in Time access to your Azure Resources.
