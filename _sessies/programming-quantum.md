In the news quantum computers are all the latest rage. While the quantum
computers we have today are still research topics and limited to toy examples, it's
still a clear vision of what our future will hold. To aid in the development and
understanding of quantum protocols, quantum algorithms, quantum error correction,
and quantum devices, Quantum Architectures and Computation Group (QuArC) has
developed new language Q#. Q# extends .Net framework with the necessary
implementations and structures to specify quantum circuits which allow developers to
emulate or can run a quantum computer as a virtual coprocessor.
