In the past four years, containers have gained a lot of traction in the
market. The question is: if you're not using them by now, shouldn't you just skip
them?
In this session you'll learn why - from a DevOps perspective - containers are dead
and serverless is the future. We'll quickly explore the basics of Azure Functions,
how they compare to containers and then continue to using these in a DevOps
environment using VSTS.
Of course we'll also look at the pitfalls and lessons learned from running
serverless applications in production and the responsibilities that you'll (still)
have.
