Picture this in your mind. Your neighbours playing Spotify in the early hours of the
morning and you are trying to sleep. Would you go over and chat to them or would you
use your phone and disable their internet. This session shows you how to do such
things and other useful skills like attacking your own web applications to look for
vulnerabilities, check if someone is snooping on your network and even how to find
beer on the internet
