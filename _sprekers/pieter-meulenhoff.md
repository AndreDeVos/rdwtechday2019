My passion is the assessment, troubleshooting and root cause analysis of a wide range of ICT infrastructures that suffer from malfunction, service interuptions and lacking performance. It is my goal to get to the originating problem, and if needed provide a solution so that you can move on. I won't hesitate for crisis situations, time pressure, or lawsuits. Typical environments are: datacenters, enterprise environments, storage systems, embedded, distributed services, mobile applications, ICT performance, DPI. 

My other passion is to realise my inventions or innovations in the field of the internet-of-things (automating pellet stoves, washing machines, text-to-speech, displays) and wearable devices (smartwatches) for the purpose of sports. You can have a look on my private website (<http://www.meulenhoff.org>) for more information.
